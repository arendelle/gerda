# Gerda

Garda is an stand alone intelligent autosuggestion server for Arendelle Language. Gerda scans Arendelle in a very fast maneuver (Only scans the substring of code's start to caret's location and scan's the string in an O(n) time).

Currently [Arendelle for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=karyfoundation.arendelle) uses Gerda for it's IntelleSense core.

## Name?
As you know our convention with Arendelle was to use names of the characters of the movie Frozen. [Gerda](http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Kai_and_Gerda) is one of the invisible servants of the castle.
